        <p >“As a 40-year veteran teacher in art schools, I am alarmed about the future of American art. Young people today, immersed in a digital universe, love the volatile excitement of virtual reality, but they lack the patience to steadily contemplate a single image—a complex static object such as a great painting or sculpture. The paintings of their world are now video games, with images in febrile motion; their sculptures are the latest-model cellphone, deftly shaped to the hand.”</p>

        <p>“I think digital artists are in a sense coping with how much material there is to work with, not only in the sense of abundance of raw imagery and information, but also art historical knowledge and influences on artistic practice. We live in mash-up culture, where sources of inspiration are endless, and it can be overwhelming.”</p>
