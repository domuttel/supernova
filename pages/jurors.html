                <p>“A carefree diapered baby riding on the back of a cat. A bald female avatar with an elongated alien head. David Bowie's eyeball that's actually a fish. Such is the world of Claudia Maté, a CGI wonderland populated with the surreal, the impossible and the eerily familiar. "It’s impossible to get bored with digital art," says Maté, speaking on her fascination with screen-based work earlier this year, "there is always an interesting new tool to learn". Her knowledge of computers started pretty early too, once fashioning a working desktop from scratch with her dad. Now the London-based artist keeps to visual creation and curation, managing cloaque.org, an ongoing collaborative thread where artists improvise off one another. Keep on top of her equally fascinating 'work diary' on Instagram.” - The digital artists to keep your eye on, DAZED, 2015</p>

                <p>Morehshin Allahyari is a new media artist, activist, educator, and occasional curator. She was born and raised in Iran and moved to the United States in 2007. Her work extensively deals with the political, social, and cultural contradictions we face every day. She thinks about technology as a philosophical toolset to reflect on objects; a poetic mean to document the personal and collective lives we live and our struggles as humans in the 21st century. Morehshin has been part of numerous exhibitions, festivals, and workshops around the world including Museum of Contemporary Art in Montreal, Pori Museum, Dallas Museum of Art, Museo Ex-Teresa Arte Actual, Contemporary Arts Museum of Houston, Museum für Angewandte Kunst, Miami Art fair, and Material Art fair. She has been an artist in residence at CMU STUDIO for Creative Inquiry (2015), Autodesk Pier9 Workshop in San Francisco (2015), and BANFF Centre (2013), among others. Her work has been featured in NYTimes, Huffington Post, Wired, NPR, VICE, Parkett Art Magazine, Rhizome, Hyperallergic, Dazed Digital, Neural Magazine, Global Voices Online, and Al Jazeera among others. Morehshin is the Co-Founder of the Experimental Research Lab at Pier9/Autodesk. Allahyari was a graduate scholar at the University of Denver in the Emergent Digital Practices department.</p>

                <p>”Morehshin Allahyari and Daniel Rourke’s expansive project #Additivism is a call for the radical rethinking of new technologies like 3D printing, the plastification of the world, and the position of humans within it. The artists posit plastic as the most significant material of our age — both metaphorically and physically, in that the substance and its remains will define the current geological age for millions of years to come. From this critical foundation they expand on a theory of weirdness, disruption, and subversion of technological techniques and “innovation,” all aimed at finding a mode of understanding that’s appropriate for the Athropocene and beyond.“ - Your Shiny Plastic Future Is a Load of Crap: Morehshin Allahyari and Daniel Rourke’s , HYPERALLERGIC, Gretta Louw, February 15, 2016</p>

                <p>JONATHAN MONAGHAN (b.1986, Rockaway Beach, NY) Lives and works in Washington, D.C. Jonathan Monaghan works across print, sculpture, and video installation. His work challenges the boundaries between the real, the imagined, and virtual. Drawing on a wide range of sources, from science fiction to Baroque architecture, he creates bizarre, yet compelling narratives and imagery with the same high-end technology used in Hollywood or by video game designers. His work has been exhibited internationally, including solo exhibitions at bitforms gallery in New York, Spazio Ridotto in Venice, and Market Gallery in Glasgow. Group exhibitions include New Frontiers at the Sundance Film Festival, The Minneapolis Institute of Art, and Postmasters Gallery. His work has been featured in The Washington Post, VICE, The Wall Street Journal, The Huffington P o s t , and The Village Voice. Monaghan has been commissioned twice by Denver Digerati for display on the 14th and Champa LED screen, first in 2012 for “SightLine” and again in 2013 for “Friday Flash No.5”.</p>

                <p>“Monaghan’s cutting-edge visual and conceptual designs convey that he is as capacious in his vision, as meticulous in his craftsmanship, and as mythopoetically literate as either Mariko Mori or Matthew Barney. Monaghan leaves his mark on 3D with the evocative stillness he imposes on a medium commercially designed for generating the fast and furious mainstream animations of blockbuster cinema productions that reduce audience attention spans. Presenting a stark contrast to the knock offs of popular culture, Monaghan distinguishes himself from the 3D artists informed by popular animation, as well as from those who use 3D to extend the media of painting and sculpture.” - Ritualized Oligarchy and the Plight of Innocence in Jonathan Monaghan’s 3D-Materialization Art, HUFFINGTON POST, G.
