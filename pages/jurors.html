    <p>Denver Digerati screened Jafri’s “Hello Bambi” during our initial Friday Flash back in May of 2013, directly impacting future programming towards an almost exclusive “digital animation” format that is now the core of Supernova. We later commissioned Jafri in 2014 for our 10-second lm festival and again in 2015 for Friday Flash No.11, resulting in his astounding short “This Ain’t Disneyland” which has since gone on to screen in over 30 lm festivals around the world. Jafri’s 2016 short “Sway” was featured in our Director’s choice screening at the inaugural edition of Supernova last year.

    <p class="profile-info box">Raquel Meyers is a Spanish artist who denes her practice as KYBDslöjd (drawing by typing). In KYBDslöjd, the screen is the canvas, a rectilinear grid on which one keystroke at a time build a character-by-character imaginary. Like crafting or the typewriter technique. It is brutality itself because it reveals what it is and what it does without adornment. Since 2004 Meyers has performed at festivals like Transmediale, Fylkingen, Piksel, Mapping, La Casa encendida and Cimatics, at 8bit events like Tokyo Blip Festival and the Playlist exhibition, as well at Liste Art Fair Basel, Ars Electronica Center, Alingsås Konsthall, Bonniers Konsthall, Xpo Gallery, Click New Media Arts Festival, Alt_Cph, BEK- Bergen Center for Electronic Arts, LABoral, iMAL, and Square Sounds among others.

    <p>Meyers entry “Vladijenk II (The corroded mainframe at Tartarus edition)” for the inaugural edition of Supernova in 2016 garnered her the festival’s second prize award, delivering a glorious array of pixelated motion that stands as a shining beacon for the historic depths of technologies inltration into art. Supernova featured a couple of Meyers’ recent publications at our preview event, which further extend her singular initiatives through purpose-ful documentation in the old-school way we still nd compelling and collectible.

        Peter Burr (b. 1980) is an artist from Brooklyn, NY, USA specializing in animation and installation. His work has been presented at venues across the world including Le Centre Pompidou, Paris; Reina Soa National Museum, Madrid; and MoMA PS1, New York. His recent work explores the concept of an endlessly mutating death labyrinth and is being expanded into a video game through the support of Creative Capital and Sundance. Previously, he worked under the alias Hooliganship and in 2006 founded the video label Cartune Xprez, through which he produced live multimedia exhibitions showcasing artists working in experimental animation.

    <p>Burr has been a major inspiration in the development of Denver Digerati ever since he brought his Cartun Xprez/Hooliganship tour to Denver’s Plus Gallery in 2006. That evening was one of the most joyous and memorable in the history of the gallery, introducing artists prominent in the development of today’s animation as well as a deeply creative and fun multi-media performance component. A prominent view of Burr’s rapidly developing work as an animator was later featured in MonkeyTown IV, a scintillating, intimate platform intertwining ne dining and contemporary motion-art launched as an extensive community experience in Denver in 2014. Burr’s “The Mess” was awarded Supernova’s prestigious Grand Prize for our inaugural competition in 2016, a 15 minute masterpiece that resonated fully in the context of a large-scale, outdoor LED presentation.
