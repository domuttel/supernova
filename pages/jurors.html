    <p>“Monaghan’s cutting-edge visual and conceptual designs convey that he is as capacious in his vision, as meticulous in his craftsmanship, and as mythopoetically literate as either Mariko Mori or Matthew Barney. Monaghan leaves his mark on 3D with the evocative stillness he imposes on a medium commercially designed for generating the fast and furious mainstream animations of blockbuster cinema productions that reduce audience attention spans. Presenting a stark contrast to the knock offs of popular culture, Monaghan distinguishes himself from the 3D artists informed by popular animation, as well as from those who use 3D to extend the media of painting and sculpture.”<b> - Ritualized Oligarchy and the Plight of Innocence in Jonathan Monaghan’s 3D-Materialization Art, HUFFINGTON POST, G. Roger Denson, June 2015</b></p>

    <p>”Morehshin Allahyari and Daniel Rourke’s expansive project #Additivism is a call for the radical rethinking of new technologies like 3D printing, the plastification of the world, and the position of humans within it. The artists posit plastic as the most significant material of our age — both metaphorically and physically, in that the substance and its remains will define the current geological age for millions of years to come. From this critical foundation they expand on a theory of weirdness, disruption, and subversion of technological techniques and “innovation,” all aimed at finding a mode of understanding that’s appropriate for the Athropocene and beyond.“<b> - Your Shiny Plastic Future Is a Load of Crap: Morehshin Allahyari and Daniel Rourke’s , HYPERALLERGIC, Gretta Louw, February 15, 2016</b></p>
