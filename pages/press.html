                  <p>“Zeile believes that this is the future of public art. Instead of cities funding (often controversial) $1 million sculptures and other static pieces of public art, as time goes on, public art will become more interactive. We see it already with indoor pieces that have projection components, and in public pieces like the towering Crown Fountain in Chicago's Millennium Park. Right now, Zeile is focused on building a network of artists, so that screens can display unique programming for hours on end – if and when the time comes, and it seems like that time is now.” NICOLE RUPERSBURG | CREATIVE EXCHANGE, JANUARY 19, 2016</p>

                  <p>“Denver Digerati is one of several projects that has elevated Denver's profile as a city that embraces and spurs innovation in creative placemaking. Over the past five years, public art in denver has transcended the traditional and terrestrial -- think blue bears and red-eyed mustangs -- to include new technologies. As a result, we've seen large-scale digital works that range from whimsical and abstract to interactive and temporary.” LAURA BOND | CONFLUENCE DENVER, OCTOBER 14, 2015</p>

                  <p>Because large-scale LED screen art remains new, Flash Friday, which kicked off in 2012, has had to figure out the ground rules on the fly. It is maturing in solid ways; the work gets more sophisticated each year and many of the commissioned works have gone on to show at film festivals across the globe.” RAY RINALDI | DENVER POST, SEPTEMBER 20, 2015</p>

                  <p>Last summer, Ivar Zeile and Ryan Pattie of Denver Digerati brought a quiet revolution to the Denver Theatre District's giant LED screens: Between the ads and promos most often seen flashing on the screens, Zeile and Pattie's curated series of short Friday Flash programs traded commerce for cutting-edge digital art and animation. Included in the package was a commission program aimed at slowly building a collection of motion-based art that could continue to show up on the LEDs in a year-round rotation...........What does the future look like for these collected works, which are the pay dirt of the whole program? You can see for yourself right now: Not only did some works currently featured at Monkey Town 4 originate on the Friday Flash screen, but "Cadavres Exquis," a ten-second spot by Dutch artist Jules Julien, is now in rotation on the screen at 14th and Arapahoe streets, showing up about every five minutes between cycling advertisements. The clip, a highly condensed .gif version of Julien's fifteen-minute original, gives a taste of the digital universe, and Zeile envisions such "ten-second film festivals" more regularly infiltrating screens throughout the year as the collection grows.

                  <p>Denver is emerging as a leader in the field known as motion-based, digital art, thanks to the success of the recently closed Monkey Town video-dinner theater and the continuing efforts of Denver Digerati, which presents new works, for free, on the jumbo LED screens downtown. Digerati's second season kicks off with a new lineup of original fare tonight. First up is "Download This/Image Anarchism," which wraps together various bits of footage downloaded from online file-sharing sourcesand edited into a fast-moving, 45-minute program. The series continues with the family-friendly "Kid Wonder," July 18 (with a convenient matinee following at 11 a.m. July 19) and the premiere of new, commis- sioned works, Sept. 19. 7 p.m. June 13, corner of 14th and Champa streets.
