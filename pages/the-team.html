    <p class="profile-info box">Ivar Zeile founded Denver Digerati in 2011 shortly after the introduction of large-scale LED screens in the Denver Theatre District, which he was tasked to integrate into a broader public art platform within the Denver’s evolving central core. Digerati is a global initiative focused on supporting artists working with rapidly developing technology utilized primarily towards advances in digital animation within contemporary art. The goal of the initiative is to develop sustainable models through an ever-expanding international network to pave the way for digital animation and motion-art to be experienced as new forms of public art. A full profile of the history of the program and developing initiatives can be found at denverdigerati.com
    <br /><br />
    Zeile has presented Denver Digerati programming in a variety of alternate contexts both public and private that promote the dynamic crossover potential for digital animation with other contemporary cultural engagements, including GOCA’s Brilliant Fundraiser (Colorado Springs, CO 2014), SSDP’s Sensory Celebration inaugural fundraiser (Arlington, VA 2014), Colorado Innovation Network’s prestigious COIN Summit (Denver, CO 2015), Firehouse Art Center’s regular cinema series (Longmont, CO 2015), and the sixth edition of CUTOUT Fest (Querétaro, Mexico, 2015). Denver Digerati commis- sioned works have been featured in a number of prestigious forums worldwide such as Slamdance Film Festival, Cannes Short Film Corner, Spring Break Art Show, MonkeyTown 4/5 and numerous other gallery and museum venues.
    <br /><br />
    Zeile has previously served as a member of the Denver Mayor's Commission for Cultural Affairs from 2006 though 2011, and in the last decade as a board member for a variety of art-related non-profit groups in Denver including PlatteForum, the Denver Art Museum's DAM Contemporaries, RedLine and the Invisible Museum. Zeile is the founder and director of Plus Gallery, one of Denver's most celebrated programs for contemporary art.

    <h3>FESTIVAL EXPERIENCE</h3>
    <p>Previous to his leadership in the Denver Arts Community, Zeile had an intense concentration in film and cinematic presentation, including two decades as a 35mm film projectionist as well as a decade working with the Sundance Film Festival in the tech department as well as overseeing all festival presentations (1991 - 2000). The Sundance Institute commissioned Zeile and a team of associates to direct and produce trailers that preceded all of the 1999 festival screenings, the only time internal staff had been awarded the prestigious commission. Since moving to Denver in 2001, Zeile has been involved with the Denver Film Society as a patron, press-writer, and festival screener. Through Plus Gallery Zeile has established an ongoing experimental program that includes video, music and performance projects that have included numerous renowned artists. Passion for visual art, innovation and community have driven almost every aspect of Zeile’s career to date, leading to the current focus to develop new protocols as models for change in society.
