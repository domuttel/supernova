Such is the world of Claudia Maté, a CGI wonderland populated with the surreal, the impossible and the eerily familiar. "It’s impossible to get bored with digital art," says Maté, speaking on her fascination with screen-based work earlier this year, "there is always an interesting new tool to learn". Her knowledge of computers started pretty early too, once fashioning a working desktop from scratch with her dad. Now the London-based artist keeps to visual creation and curation, managing cloaque.org, an ongoing collaborative thread where artists improvise off one another. Keep on top of her equally fascinating 'work diary' on Instagram.”

<div class="page-titles after-thing">
    <p>”Morehshin Allahyari and Daniel Rourke’s expansive project #Additivism is a call for the radical rethinking of new technologies like 3D printing, the plastification of the world, and the position of humans within it. The artists posit plastic as the most significant material of our age — both metaphorically and physically, in that the substance and its remains will define the current geological age for millions of years to come. From this critical foundation they expand on a theory of weirdness, disruption, and subversion of technological techniques and “innovation,” all aimed at finding a mode of understanding that’s appropriate for the Athropocene and beyond.“

        JONATHAN MONAGHAN (b.1986, Rockaway Beach, NY) Lives and works in Washington, D.C. Jonathan Monaghan works across print, sculpture, and video installation. His work challenges the boundaries between the real, the imagined, and virtual. Drawing on a wide range of sources, from science fiction to Baroque architecture, he creates bizarre, yet compelling narratives and imagery with the same high-end technology used in Hollywood or by video game designers. His work has been exhibited internationally, including solo exhibitions at bitforms gallery in New York, Spazio Ridotto in Venice, and Market Gallery in Glasgow. Group exhibitions include New Frontiers at the Sundance Film Festival, The Minneapolis Institute of Art, and Postmasters Gallery. His work has been featured in The Washington Post, VICE, The Wall Street Journal, The Huffington P o s t , and The Village Voice.

    <p>“Monaghan’s cutting-edge visual and conceptual designs convey that he is as capacious in his vision, as meticulous in his craftsmanship, and as mythopoetically literate as either Mariko Mori or Matthew Barney. Monaghan leaves his mark on 3D with the evocative stillness he imposes on a medium commercially designed for generating the fast and furious mainstream animations of blockbuster cinema productions that reduce audience attention spans. Presenting a stark contrast to the knock offs of popular culture, Monaghan distinguishes himself from the 3D artists informed by popular animation, as well as from those who use 3D to extend the media of painting and sculpture.”

    <p class="profile-info box">Ivar Zeile founded Denver Digerati in 2011 shortly after the introduc- tion of large-scale LED screens in the Denver Theatre District, which he was tasked to integrate into a broader public art platform within the Denver’s evolving central core. Digerati is a global initiative focused on supporting artists working with rapidly developing technology utilized primarily towards advances in digital animation within contemporary art. The goal of the initiative is to develop sustainable models through an ever-expanding international network to pave the way for digital animation and motion-art to be experienced as new forms of public art. A full profile of the history of the program and developing initiatives can be found at denverdigerati.com
    <br /><br />
    Zeile has presented Denver Digerati programming in a variety of alternate contexts both public and private that promote the dynamic crossover potential for digital animation with other contemporary cultural engagements, including GOCA’s Brilliant Fundraiser (Colorado Springs, CO 2014), SSDP’s Sensory Celebration inaugural fundraiser (Arlington, VA 2014), Colorado Innovation Network’s prestigious COIN Summit (Denver, CO 2015), Firehouse Art Center’s regular cinema series (Longmont, CO 2015), and the sixth edition of CUTOUT Fest (Querétaro, Mexico, 2015). Denver Digerati commis- sioned works have been featured in a number of prestigious forums worldwide such as Slamdance Film Festival, Cannes Short Film Corner, Spring Break Art Show, MonkeyTown 4/5 and numerous other gallery and museum venues.

    Zeile has previously served as a member of the Denver Mayor's Commission for Cultural Affairs from 2006 though 2011, and in the last decade as a board member for a variety of art-related non-profit groups in Denver including PlatteForum, the Denver Art Museum's DAM Contemporaries, RedLine and the Invisible Museum.

    <h3>FESTIVAL EXPERIENCE</h3>
    <p>Previous to his leadership in the Denver Arts Community, Zeile had an intense concentration in film and cinematic presentation, including two decades as a 35mm film projectionist as well as a decade working with the Sundance Film Festival in the tech department as well as overseeing all festival presentations (1991 - 2000). The Sundance Institute commissioned Zeile and a team of associates to direct and produce trailers that preceded all of the 1999 festival screenings, the only time internal staff had been awarded the prestigious commission. Since moving to Denver in 2001, Zeile has been involved with the Denver Film Society as a patron, press-writer, and festival screener. Through Plus Gallery Zeile has established an ongoing experimental program that includes video, music and performance projects that have included numerous renowned artists. Passion for visual art, innovation and community have driven almost every aspect of Zeile’s career to date, leading to the current focus to develop new protocols as models for change in society.

Instead of cities funding (often controversial) $1 million sculptures and other static pieces of public art, as time goes on, public art will become more interactive. We see it already with indoor pieces that have projection components, and in public pieces like the towering Crown Fountain in Chicago's Millennium Park. Right now, Zeile is focused on building a network of artists, so that screens can display unique programming for hours on end – if and when the time comes, and it seems like that time is now.”

    <span class="news-article box">Last summer, Ivar Zeile and Ryan Pattie of Denver Digerati brought a quiet revolution to the Denver Theatre District's giant LED screens: Between the ads and promos most often seen flashing on the screens, Zeile and Pattie's curated series of short Friday Flash programs traded commerce for cutting-edge digital art and animation. Included in the package was a commission program aimed at slowly building a collection of motion-based art that could continue to show up on the LEDs in a year-round rotation...........What does the future look like for these collected works, which are the pay dirt of the whole program? You can see for yourself right now: Not only did some works currently featured at Monkey Town 4 originate on the Friday Flash screen, but "Cadavres Exquis," a ten-second spot by Dutch artist Jules Julien, is now in rotation on the screen at 14th and Arapahoe streets, showing up about every five minutes between cycling advertisements. The clip, a highly condensed .gif version of Julien's fifteen-minute original, gives a taste of the digital universe, and Zeile envisions such "ten-second film festivals" more regularly infiltrating screens throughout the year as the collection grows.

    <span class="news-article box">Denver is emerging as a leader in the field known as motion-based, digital art, thanks to the success of the recently closed Monkey Town video-dinner theater and the continuing efforts of Denver Digerati, which presents new works, for free, on the jumbo LED screens downtown. Digerati's second season kicks off with a new lineup of original fare tonight. First up is "Download This/Image Anarchism," which wraps together various bits of footage downloaded from online file-sharing sourcesand edited into a fast-moving, 45-minute program. The series continues with the family-friendly "Kid Wonder," July 18 (with a convenient matinee following at 11 a.m. July 19) and the premiere of new, commis- sioned works, Sept. 19. 7 p.m. June 13, corner of 14th and Champa streets.
