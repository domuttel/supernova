<h1>FRIDAY FLASH #10: Now!</h1>
<h3>2015</h3>


<p>Denver Digerati presented “Friday Flash No.10 - Digital Animation NOW” to the public on Friday July 24th in downtown Denver, Colorado on the 14th and Champa Street LED screen. The approximately 45 minute program is an adjunct to the 2015 Biennial of the Americas, taking the Biennial theme of NOW! and celebrating what is firmly some of the leading artists from around the world who are engaged in digital animation as a form of contemporary art. It is one of Denver Digerati’s most stunning collections to date, further advancing a singular, exciting artist network that has been the cornerstone of Denver Digerati’s curatorial efforts.</p> 

<p>With FF No.10 Denver Digerati, for the first time, introduces one of the most unusual veins in digital animation today, drawing top artists from within the “Machinema” and “Second Life” genres that use gaming protocols to develop long-form, narrative works that can border on the absurd as well as the sublime, with SaveMe Oh being one of the best examples and Valentina Rebecca Tremont serving equally as a remarkable entity within the genre. Denver will also be represented by the recently discovered animations of Travis Vermilye, an instructor at UCD who uses his incredible skills in digital animation to help society better understand science.</p>
