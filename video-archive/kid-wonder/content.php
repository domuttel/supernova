<h1>FRIDAY FLASH #7: KID WONDER</h1>
<h3>2014</h3>
<p>Friday Flash #7: &nbsp;Kid Wonder premiered on Friday, July 18th at 8pm and again on Saturday, July 19th at 11am, both hosted by the Denver Theatre District on LED screens located at the corner of 14th and Champa Street. The basis for Kid Wonder was to explore short-form animations and digital artworks that inspire the imaginations of kids as well as adults. The spark of interest struck in a younger generation lends a particularly keen interest to the pulse within public art programming possibilities. Kid Wonder serves as an example of the overriding accessibility and 'wonder'¬ù inherent in art that is firmly of today yet rooted in artistic tradition.</p>
